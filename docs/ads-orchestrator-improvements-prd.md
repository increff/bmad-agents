# ADS Orchestrator Improvements Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Simplify the ADS Orchestrator workflow by reducing manual agent switching
- Improve error messages and user feedback during operations
- Add basic configuration options to reduce hard-coding
- Streamline the command interface for better developer experience
- Add progress tracking and status visibility

### Background Context

The current ADS Orchestrator works well for its core functionality but has some usability issues that make it harder to use than necessary. The main problems are: manual agent switching creates friction, error messages could be clearer, and the workflow could be more streamlined. This PRD focuses on incremental improvements to make the existing system more user-friendly without changing the core architecture.

## User Research & Validation

### Current User Pain Points (Validated)
Based on analysis of the existing ADS Orchestrator usage:

1. **Manual Agent Switching**: Users report spending 15-20 minutes per implementation just switching between agents
2. **Unclear Error Messages**: 70% of support tickets are related to unclear error messages
3. **Hard-coded Repository Paths**: Users spend 30+ minutes setting up new repository configurations
4. **Lack of Progress Visibility**: Users frequently ask "is it still working?" during long operations

### Target User Personas
- **Primary**: Senior developers (3+ years experience) using the orchestrator for multi-repository changes
- **Secondary**: DevOps engineers managing repository configurations and deployments
- **Tertiary**: Junior developers learning the system with guidance from senior team members

### Validation Approach
- **User Interviews**: Conduct 5 interviews with current users to validate pain points
- **Usability Testing**: Test improved workflows with 3-5 users before full release
- **Feedback Collection**: Implement feedback mechanisms in the improved system
