## Best Practices

### Migration Planning
1. **Analyze Requirements**: Understand what changes need migration
2. **Choose Correct Branches**: Use environment-specific base branches
3. **Review Commit History**: Ensure commits are ready for migration
4. **Plan Testing**: Define validation strategy before starting

### During Migration
1. **Monitor Progress**: Use verbose mode for detailed progress tracking
2. **Review Validations**: Check rule compliance at each phase
3. **Handle Conflicts**: Use expert guidance for pattern conflicts
4. **Test Incrementally**: Validate after each commit implementation

### Post-Migration
1. **Review Reports**: Analyze all generated reports thoroughly
2. **Test Integration**: Verify changes work in target environment
3. **Update Documentation**: Ensure all documentation is current
4. **Monitor Performance**: Check for any performance impacts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Repository Not Accessible**
```
Error: Repository directory not found
```
- Verify repository path is correct
- Ensure repository is cloned locally
- Check file system permissions

**Branch Not Found**
```
Error: Source/target branch not found
```
- Verify branch names are correct
- Fetch latest branches from remote
- Check repository state

**Pattern Analysis Failed**
```
Error: Pattern analysis failed
```
- Check repository structure matches expected patterns
- Verify language-specific files are present
- Review repository for unusual configurations

**Validation Failures**
```
Rule compliance below threshold
```
- Review validation report for specific failures
- Address rule violations manually
- Consider expert agent guidance

### Getting Help

1. **Verbose Mode**: Use `--verbose` for detailed progress information
2. **Dry Run**: Use `--dry-run` to preview migration without changes
3. **Check Reports**: Review all generated reports for detailed error information
4. **Expert Guidance**: Consult expert agents for complex pattern issues

## Integration with VIRAT

This migration system implements the `*implement-migration` command from VIRAT:

```bash
# VIRAT command (conceptual)
