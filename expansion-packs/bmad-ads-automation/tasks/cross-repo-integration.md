# Cross-Repository Integration Validation

## Overview

This task implements cross-repository integration validation to ensure changes in one repository don't break integration with others.

## Steps

### 1. Validate Repo Integration

- Ensure changes maintain cross-repository compatibility
- Check integration points between LoadAPI, Config, and Algorithm repos
- Validate data contracts and interfaces between repositories
- Verify integration consistency and stability

### 2. Detect Integration Breaking Changes

- Find changes that break repository integration
- Identify breaking changes in data contracts and interfaces
- Detect incompatible changes across repositories
- Generate integration breaking change reports

### 3. Generate Integration Tests

- Create tests for cross-repository functionality
- Generate integration test suites for repository interactions
- Validate end-to-end integration scenarios
- Ensure comprehensive integration test coverage

### 4. Validate Data Contracts

- Ensure data contracts between repositories are maintained
- Check for data format and structure consistency
- Validate API contracts and interfaces
- Verify data contract compliance

### 5. Suggest Integration Improvements

- Recommend integration pattern improvements
- Suggest better integration architectures
- Identify opportunities for integration optimization
- Generate integration improvement recommendations

## Expected Outcomes

- Zero cross-repository integration breaking changes
- Complete integration test coverage
- Maintained data contract consistency
- Optimized integration patterns

## Validation Criteria

- All repository changes maintain integration compatibility
- Integration tests cover all cross-repository interactions
- Data contracts are consistent and maintained
- Integration patterns are optimized and reliable
