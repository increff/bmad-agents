# LoadAPI Pattern Recognition & Template Generation

## Overview

This task implements LoadAPI pattern recognition and template generation to ensure consistent implementations and reduce errors.

## Steps

### 1. Analyze LoadAPI Patterns

- Study existing LoadAPI implementations across all modules
- Identify common patterns in class structure, methods, and inheritance
- Analyze successful LoadAPI implementations for best practices
- Document pattern variations and their use cases

### 2. Generate LoadAPI Templates

- Create templates based on successful LoadAPI patterns
- Generate templates for different LoadAPI types (analysis, inventory, etc.)
- Include proper inheritance, method signatures, and structure
- Provide template customization options

### 3. Validate LoadAPI Structure

- Ensure proper inheritance from LoadApi base class
- Validate method implementation patterns
- Check for required imports and dependencies
- Verify naming conventions and structure

### 4. Detect Pattern Violations

- Find LoadAPIs that don't follow established patterns
- Identify structural inconsistencies and deviations
- Detect missing required methods or imports
- Flag potential implementation issues

### 5. Suggest Pattern Improvements

- Recommend pattern compliance fixes for non-conforming LoadAPIs
- Suggest structural improvements for better consistency
- Provide guidance on proper LoadAPI implementation
- Generate improvement recommendations

## Expected Outcomes

- Consistent LoadAPI implementations across all modules
- Reduced implementation errors and inconsistencies
- Automated template generation for new LoadAPIs
- Pattern compliance validation

## Validation Criteria

- All LoadAPIs follow established patterns
- Templates generate valid LoadAPI implementations
- Pattern violations are detected and reported
- Improvement suggestions are actionable and specific
