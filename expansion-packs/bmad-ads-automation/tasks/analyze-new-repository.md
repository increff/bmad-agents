# Analyze New Repository

## Overview

This task performs comprehensive analysis of a new repository to understand its structure, patterns, technologies, and integration requirements.

## Steps

### 1. Repository Structure Discovery

- Scan repository directory structure and file organization
- Identify main directories, modules, and components
- Map file types and programming languages used
- Discover configuration files and build systems
- Analyze project structure and organization patterns

### 2. Technology Stack Analysis

- Identify programming languages and frameworks
- Detect build tools, package managers, and dependencies
- Analyze database technologies and data storage patterns
- Identify testing frameworks and quality tools
- Map deployment and infrastructure technologies

### 3. Code Pattern Discovery

- Analyze coding patterns and architectural styles
- Identify design patterns and implementation approaches
- Discover naming conventions and coding standards
- Analyze error handling and logging patterns
- Identify security patterns and practices

### 4. Dependency Analysis

- Map internal dependencies between modules
- Identify external dependencies and libraries
- Analyze dependency versions and compatibility
- Discover circular dependencies and potential issues
- Map dependency relationships and hierarchies

### 5. Integration Point Identification

- Identify potential integration points with existing repositories
- Analyze data flow and communication patterns
- Discover API endpoints and interfaces
- Identify configuration and environment requirements
- Map integration touchpoints and dependencies

## Expected Outcomes

- Comprehensive repository profile and analysis report
- Technology stack documentation
- Pattern catalog and architectural analysis
- Dependency map and relationship diagram
- Integration requirements and recommendations

## Validation Criteria

- All repository components are identified and analyzed
- Technology stack is completely mapped
- Patterns are correctly identified and cataloged
- Dependencies are accurately mapped
- Integration points are clearly identified
