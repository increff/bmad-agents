# Generate Test Reports Task

## Purpose

Generate basic test reports that consolidate results from unit tests focused on static methods to provide a simple quality assessment.

## Steps

### 1. Collect Basic Test Results

1. **Gather Static Method Test Results**:

   ```bash
   # Collect Java static method test results
   cd $REPO_PATH
   mvn test -Dtest="*UtilTest,*HelperTest,*ConstantsTest"
   cp target/surefire-reports/*.xml reports/static-tests-java.xml

   # Collect Python static function test results
   cd $LOADAPI_PATH
   python -m pytest tests/unit/test_*_utils.py --junitxml=reports/static-tests-python.xml
   ```

### 2. Analyze Basic Test Coverage

1. **Calculate Basic Coverage**:
   - Aggregate coverage from static method tests
   - Calculate coverage by repository
   - Calculate coverage by static method
   - Identify basic coverage gaps

2. **Basic Coverage Analysis**:
   - Static method coverage analysis
   - Utility function coverage analysis
   - Basic function coverage analysis

3. **Basic Coverage Reporting**:
   - Generate simple coverage reports
   - Document basic coverage metrics
   - Identify static methods needing additional tests

### 3. Basic Quality Metrics Analysis

1. **Basic Code Quality Metrics**:
   - Static method complexity analysis
   - Basic code style compliance
   - Simple security checks for static methods

2. **Basic Quality Reporting**:
   - Generate simple quality reports
   - Document basic quality metrics
   - Provide basic quality recommendations

### 4. Generate Basic Report

1. **Report Structure**:

   ```markdown
   # Basic Test Execution Report

   ## Summary

   - Static method test results
   - Basic metrics and findings
   - Simple recommendations

   ## Test Results Summary

   - Static method test results
   - Utility function test results

   ## Basic Coverage Analysis

   - Static method coverage metrics
   - Coverage gaps and recommendations

   ## Basic Quality Metrics

   - Static method quality analysis
   - Basic quality recommendations

   ## Issues and Recommendations

   - Static method test failures
   - Basic improvement recommendations
   - Next steps
   ```

2. **Basic Report Generation**:
   - Create simple HTML report
   - Create basic JSON data export
   - Generate simple summary

3. **Basic Report Distribution**:
   - Save reports to designated location
   - Archive reports for tracking
   - Update basic documentation

### 5. Basic Test Report Validation

1. **Report Completeness**:
   - Ensure static method test results included
   - Validate basic report accuracy
   - Check basic report formatting

2. **Basic Report Quality**:
   - Review basic report content
   - Validate basic metrics
   - Ensure report clarity

## Output

- **Basic Test Report**: Simple test execution report with static method results
- **Basic Coverage Report**: Simple test coverage analysis for static methods
- **Basic Quality Report**: Basic code quality metrics for static methods
- **Simple Summary**: Basic summary of static method test results
