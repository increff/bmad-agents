# Generate Integration Plan

## Overview

This task generates a comprehensive integration plan for incorporating a new repository into the VIRAT ecosystem.

## Steps

### 1. Integration Requirements Analysis

- Analyze integration requirements based on repository analysis
- Identify integration goals and success criteria
- Map integration scope and boundaries
- Define integration phases and milestones
- Establish integration timeline and resources

### 2. Conflict Detection and Resolution

- Identify potential conflicts with existing repositories
- Analyze dependency conflicts and version mismatches
- Detect configuration conflicts and overlaps
- Identify naming conflicts and resource conflicts
- Plan conflict resolution strategies

### 3. Integration Architecture Design

- Design integration architecture and patterns
- Plan data flow and communication patterns
- Design configuration management approach
- Plan security and access control integration
- Design monitoring and logging integration

### 4. Implementation Strategy

- Define implementation phases and approach
- Plan incremental integration strategy
- Design rollback and recovery mechanisms
- Plan testing and validation approach
- Define deployment and release strategy

### 5. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

- Identify integration risks and challenges
- Assess impact and probability of risks
- Develop risk mitigation strategies
- Plan contingency and fallback options
- Define risk monitoring and management

## Expected Outcomes

- Comprehensive integration plan document
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Integration architecture design
- Implementation roadmap and timeline
- Risk assessment and mitigation plan

## Validation Criteria

- All integration requirements are addressed
- Conflicts are identified and resolved
- Architecture is well-designed and feasible
