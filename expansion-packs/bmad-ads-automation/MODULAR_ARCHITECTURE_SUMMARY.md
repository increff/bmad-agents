## Usage

### Complete Workflow

```
*implement
```

This automatically coordinates all 7 sub-agents through the complete development lifecycle.

### Individual Agent Invocation

```
*analyze    # Just analysis
*develop    # Just development
*test       # Just testing
*validate   # Just validation
*document   # Just documentation
*patterns   # Just pattern validation
```

### Status and Management

```
*status     # Current implementation status
*config     # Manage configuration
*progress   # Real-time progress
*errors     # Recent errors with recovery suggestions
```

## Migration from Monolithic Architecture

### Before

- Single monolithic VIRAT agent with 900+ lines
- All responsibilities in one agent
- Difficult to maintain and extend
- Overlapping concerns
- Hard to test individual capabilities

### After

- 7 specialized agents with clear boundaries
- Each agent ~150-200 lines
- Easy to maintain and extend
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to test individual capabilities

## Future Enhancements

- Add more specialized agents as needed (e.g., Security Expert, Performance Expert)
- Enhance orchestration with more sophisticated coordination patterns
- Add agent-to-agent communication protocols
- Implement agent capability discovery and dynamic routing
- Add agent performance monitoring and optimization
