# Feedback Collection Checklist

## Pre-Collection Preparation

- [ ] Identify the specific issue or problem with generated code/plan
- [ ] Gather context about the task being performed
- [ ] Note which agent was used for the implementation
- [ ] Document the expected vs actual outcome
- [ ] Prepare specific examples of what went wrong

## Feedback Collection Process

### Issue Documentation
- [ ] **What went wrong?** - Clear description of the issue
- [ ] **Generated output** - Capture the incorrect code/plan generated
- [ ] **Expected output** - Document what was expected
- [ ] **Impact assessment** - Rate the severity (high/medium/low)
- [ ] **Error type classification** - Pattern violation, business logic, integration, etc.

### Context Capture
- [ ] **Repository context** - Which repository was being worked on
- [ ] **Module context** - Which module or component
- [ ] **Task type** - Analysis, development, testing, validation, documentation
- [ ] **Agent used** - Which BMAD agent was involved
- [ ] **Timestamp** - When the issue occurred
- [ ] **Developer** - Who reported the issue

### Solution Documentation
- [ ] **Correct approach** - How it should have been done
- [ ] **Correct code/plan** - The proper implementation
- [ ] **Explanation** - Why this approach is correct
- [ ] **Best practices** - Any relevant best practices
- [ ] **Prevention tips** - How to avoid this mistake in future

### Learning Integration
- [ ] **Pattern identification** - What pattern or rule was violated
- [ ] **Root cause analysis** - Why did this mistake happen
- [ ] **Prevention strategy** - How to prevent similar mistakes
- [ ] **Improvement suggestion** - How to improve the agent/system
- [ ] **Knowledge base update** - Update relevant knowledge base entries

## Quality Assurance

### Feedback Quality Check
- [ ] Feedback is specific and actionable
- [ ] Both wrong and correct approaches are documented
- [ ] Context is complete and accurate
- [ ] Learning insights are captured
- [ ] Prevention strategies are identified

### Data Validation
- [ ] All required fields are filled
- [ ] Timestamps are accurate
- [ ] JSON structure is valid
- [ ] No sensitive information is included
- [ ] Data is properly categorized

## Post-Collection Actions

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Store feedback in examples.json
- [ ] Update feedback patterns if applicable
- [ ] Generate improvement suggestions
- [ ] Notify relevant agents of learning

### Follow-up Actions
- [ ] Analyze feedback for patterns
- [ ] Update knowledge base
- [ ] Generate learning examples
- [ ] Track improvement implementation
- [ ] Monitor for similar issues

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Feedback is comprehensive and actionable
- [ ] Learning is captured and stored
- [ ] Prevention strategies are identified
- [ ] Improvement suggestions are generated
- [ ] Knowledge base is updated
- [ ] Future similar mistakes are prevented

## Notes

- Always be empathetic when collecting feedback
- Focus on learning and improvement, not blame
- Capture both technical and process improvements
- Ensure feedback leads to actionable changes
- Track the impact of improvements over time
