# Task: Prioritize Test Cases

## Objective
To create a prioritized test execution plan based on the risk assessment and business impact, categorizing tests from P0 (Critical) to P3 (Low).

## Actions
1.  **Define Priority Levels**: Establish clear definitions for P0, P1, P2, and P3 priority levels for each repository.
2.  **Map Components to Priorities**: Map the identified high-risk components to the defined priority levels.
3.  **Apply Prioritization Rules**:
    -   Start with business impact.
    -   Consider the likelihood of failure.
    -   Factor in detectability and recoverability.
4.  **Create Test Matrix**: Generate a test priority matrix that outlines which test suites or modules fall into each priority level.

## Implementation Details
-   The test priority matrices will be stored in a YAML file or within the orchestrator's logic.
-   **`irisx-algo`**: P0 tests will target core modules like `distribution`, `otb`, and `reordering`.
-   **`irisx-config`**: P0 tests will focus on database migrations and critical export/sync queries.
-   **`ms-loadapis`**: P0 tests will cover Azure authentication and core API integration.
-   The orchestrator will use this matrix to guide the test execution phase.
