# Task: Validate Algorithm Outputs

## Objective
To perform comprehensive validation of algorithm output files to detect regressions, data quality issues, and ensure consistency.

## Actions
1.  **Schema Validation**: Verify that output files conform to expected schemas and data formats.
2.  **Data Quality Checks**: Validate data integrity, completeness, consistency, and accuracy.
3.  **Regression Detection**: Compare current outputs with baseline or previous versions to identify regressions.
4.  **Performance Analysis**: Analyze file sizes, generation times, and processing efficiency.
5.  **Cross-Validation**: Compare related outputs for consistency and logical relationships.

## Implementation Details
-   Validate file formats, headers, and data structure consistency.
-   Check for missing data, null values, and data type mismatches.
-   Compare current outputs with baseline files to detect changes and regressions.
-   Analyze performance metrics like file size and processing time.
-   Generate validation reports with specific issues and recommendations.
