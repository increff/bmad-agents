# Task: Assess Likelihood of Failure

## Objective
To evaluate the probability that the identified high-risk components will fail, based on their complexity, dependencies, and change frequency.

## Actions
1.  **Code Complexity Analysis**:
    -   **`irisx-algo`**: Use tools to assess cyclomatic complexity of Java code and analyze Maven dependency trees.
    -   **`irisx-config`**: Analyze the complexity of SQL scripts, counting the number of migrations and regression test data files.
    -   **`ms-loadapis`**: Assess Python code complexity and analyze dependencies.
2.  **Change Frequency Analysis**: Analyze `git log` history to determine the frequency of changes for high-risk components.
3.  **Test Coverage Analysis**:
    -   **`irisx-algo`**: Run `mvn jacoco:report` to get a baseline coverage report.
    -   **`ms-loadapis`**: Run `coverage report` to assess Python test coverage.
4.  **Risk Scoring**: Assign a risk score (e.g., 1-10) to components based on the gathered metrics.

## Implementation Details
-   The orchestrator delegates the specific analysis tasks to the expert agents.
-   **Java Expert**: Handles Maven dependency analysis and JaCoCo reports.
-   **SQL Expert**: Analyzes the number and complexity of migration scripts and SQL files.
-   **Python Expert**: Manages `pip` dependency analysis and coverage reports.
-   The results are compiled into a risk assessment matrix.
