# Task: Iterate and Refine

## Objective
To continuously improve the regression testing process by analyzing results, identifying patterns, and refining the strategy.

## Actions
1.  **Analyze Test Results**:
    -   Review test failures, stack traces, and error messages.
    -   Analyze test execution times to identify slow tests.
2.  **Analyze Coverage Gaps**:
    -   **`irisx-algo`**: Review JaCoCo reports.
    -   **`ms-loadapis`**: Review `coverage.py` reports.
3.  **Identify Patterns**: Look for recurring issues, flaky tests, or areas with consistently low coverage.
4.  **Update Priorities**: Adjust the risk assessment and test priorities based on the findings from the latest run.
5.  **Refine Strategy**: Propose and document improvements to the testing strategy, such as adding new tests, refactoring existing ones, or optimizing the execution environment.
6.  **Generate Final Report**: The orchestrator compiles all findings into a comprehensive regression test report.

## Implementation Details
-   The expert agents will provide detailed analysis reports for their respective repositories.
-   The orchestrator aggregates this information and uses it to update the central risk and priority matrices.
-   The final report will include a summary of results, key findings, and actionable recommendations for improving the testing process.
