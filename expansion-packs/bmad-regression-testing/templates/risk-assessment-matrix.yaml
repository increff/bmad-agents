# Risk Assessment Matrix Template (edit per project)

criteria:
  complexity_weight: 0.35   # code complexity and coupling
  change_freq_weight: 0.25  # recent commit frequency
  dependency_weight: 0.20   # number/criticality of dependencies
  coverage_weight: 0.15     # current test coverage
  history_weight: 0.05      # historical failures

scales:
  complexity:    {low: 1, medium: 5, high: 9}
  change_freq:   {low: 1, medium: 5, high: 9}
  dependency:    {low: 1, medium: 5, high: 9}
  coverage:      {high: 1, medium: 5, low: 9}
  history:       {none: 1, occasional: 5, frequent: 9}
