# Generate Improvement Suggestions Task

## Task Overview
Generate actionable improvement suggestions based on feedback analysis and learning insights.

## Prerequisites
- Feedback analysis has been completed
- Learning insights have been extracted
- Knowledge base has been updated

## Task Steps

### Step 1: Analysis Review
**auto: true**
```python
# Review feedback analysis
analysis_results = load_analysis_results()
patterns = analysis_results["patterns"]
trends = analysis_results["trends"]
root_causes = analysis_results["root_causes"]
```

### Step 2: Improvement Opportunity Identification
**auto: true**
```python
# Identify improvement opportunities
improvement_opportunities = identify_improvement_opportunities(analysis_results)
high_impact_areas = identify_high_impact_areas(analysis_results)
quick_wins = identify_quick_wins(analysis_results)
```

### Step 3: Suggestion Generation
**auto: true**
```python
# Generate improvement suggestions
suggestions = []
for opportunity in improvement_opportunities:
    suggestion = {
        "id": generate_unique_id(),
        "title": opportunity["title"],
        "description": opportunity["description"],
        "priority": calculate_priority(opportunity),
        "impact": opportunity["impact"],
        "effort": opportunity["effort"],
        "category": opportunity["category"],
        "specific_actions": generate_specific_actions(opportunity),
        "success_metrics": define_success_metrics(opportunity),
        "implementation_plan": create_implementation_plan(opportunity)
    }
    suggestions.append(suggestion)
```

### Step 4: Priority Ranking
**auto: true**
```python
# Rank suggestions by priority
ranked_suggestions = rank_suggestions_by_priority(suggestions)
high_priority = [s for s in ranked_suggestions if s["priority"] == "high"]
medium_priority = [s for s in ranked_suggestions if s["priority"] == "medium"]
low_priority = [s for s in ranked_suggestions if s["priority"] == "low"]
```

### Step 5: Implementation Planning
**auto: true**
```python
# Create implementation plans
for suggestion in high_priority:
    implementation_plan = {
        "suggestion_id": suggestion["id"],
        "phases": create_implementation_phases(suggestion),
        "timeline": estimate_timeline(suggestion),
        "resources": identify_required_resources(suggestion),
        "dependencies": identify_dependencies(suggestion),
        "risks": identify_risks(suggestion),
        "mitigation_strategies": create_mitigation_strategies(suggestion)
    }
    suggestion["implementation_plan"] = implementation_plan
```

### Step 6: Success Metrics Definition
**auto: true**
```python
# Define success metrics for each suggestion
for suggestion in suggestions:
    success_metrics = {
        "quantitative": define_quantitative_metrics(suggestion),
        "qualitative": define_qualitative_metrics(suggestion),
        "baseline": establish_baseline(suggestion),
        "target": set_targets(suggestion),
        "measurement_method": define_measurement_method(suggestion)
    }
    suggestion["success_metrics"] = success_metrics
```

### Step 7: Suggestion Documentation
**auto: true**
```python
# Document improvement suggestions
improvement_report = {
    "summary": {
        "total_suggestions": len(suggestions),
        "high_priority": len(high_priority),
        "medium_priority": len(medium_priority),
        "low_priority": len(low_priority)
    },
    "suggestions": ranked_suggestions,
    "implementation_roadmap": create_implementation_roadmap(ranked_suggestions),
    "success_metrics": aggregate_success_metrics(suggestions)
}

# Save improvement suggestions
save_improvement_suggestions(improvement_report)
```

## Output
- Ranked improvement suggestions
- Implementation plans
- Success metrics
- Implementation roadmap
- Improvement report

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Improvement opportunities identified
- [ ] Suggestions generated and ranked
- [ ] Implementation plans created
- [ ] Success metrics defined
- [ ] Improvement report generated
- [ ] Suggestions stored and documented

## Notes
- Focus on actionable and implementable suggestions
- Consider both immediate and long-term improvements
- Balance impact with effort required
- Define clear success metrics
- Create realistic implementation timelines
