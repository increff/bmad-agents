- Runs after Phase 4 completion but before final documentation
- Collects context from implementation artifacts and git changes

### Learning Application

- VIRAT loads relevant learnings at start of new implementations
- Past feedback influences implementation approach selection
- Accumulated knowledge improves pattern recognition and solution selection

### Continuous Improvement Loop

- Feedback drives updates to VIRAT's core rules and processes
- Learning patterns influence expert agent recommendations
- Success metrics guide process optimization priorities
