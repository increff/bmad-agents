# Prod Environment Integration - Multi-Environment Support Enhancement

**Date**: 2025-10-21  
**Status**: âœ… Completed  
**Impact**: All three environments (prod, reliance, phoenix) now fully integrated in multi-environment support

---

## Summary of Changes

VIRAT now supports **prod** environment alongside **reliance** and **phoenix** in the multi-environment support system. This allows deploying to any combination of the three environments in a single requirement document.

---

## Environment Configuration

### Branch Mappings

| Environment | Algorithm Branch | LoadAPI Branch | Config Branch |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **prod** | `caas-release` | `release_optimised` | `caas-staging_fix` |
| **reliance** | `master-ril` | `caas-ril-uploads` | `master-ril` |
| **phoenix** | `master-adidas-reliance-prod` | `caas-phoenix-uploads` | `master-adidas-ril` |

---

## Usage Examples

### Single Environment Deployment

Deploy to prod only:
```markdown
**Environment**: prod
```

Deploy to reliance only:
```markdown
**Environment**: reliance
```

Deploy to phoenix only:
```markdown
**Environment**: phoenix
```

### Multiple Environment Deployment

Deploy to prod and reliance:
```markdown
**Environment**: prod, reliance
```

Deploy to all three environments:
```markdown
**Environment**: prod, reliance, phoenix
```

Deploy in specific order (staged rollout):
```markdown
**Environment**: prod, reliance, phoenix
```
(VIRAT will process prod first, then reliance, then phoenix sequentially)

---

## How It Works

When you run `*implement` with multiple environments:

1. **Environment Detection**: VIRAT reads the Environment field from your requirement document
2. **Sequential Processing**: For each environment specified:
   - Switch to environment's base branches
   - Create environment-specific feature branch (e.g., `feature/REQ-1234-description-prod`)
   - Complete all implementation phases (0-6)
   - Run tests
   - Push changes to repository
3. **Documentation**: All environments are documented in the requirement with branch URLs and results

---

## Example Workflow

### Requirement Document
```markdown
# Requirement: Add Store Performance Validation

**Requirement ID**: REQ-7890  
**Environment**: prod, reliance, phoenix  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Created**: 2025-10-21

## Description
Add store performance validation logic for all three environments.
This validation needs to be consistent across prod, Reliance, and Phoenix environments.
```

### Execution
```bash
*implement REQ-7890.md
```

### Result
- Feature branch created for prod: `feature/REQ-7890-store-validation-prod` (from `caas-release`)
- Feature branch created for reliance: `feature/REQ-7890-store-validation-reliance` (from `master-ril`)
- Feature branch created for phoenix: `feature/REQ-7890-store-validation-phoenix` (from `master-adidas-reliance-prod`)
- All changes implemented, tested, and pushed
- Documentation updated for each environment

---

## Branch Naming Convention

- **Single Environment**: `feature/REQ-1234-description`
- **Multiple Environments**: `feature/REQ-1234-description-{environment}`

Examples:
- `feature/REQ-7890-store-validation-prod`
- `feature/REQ-7890-store-validation-reliance`
- `feature/REQ-7890-store-validation-phoenix`

---

## Benefits

âœ… **Unified Deployment**: Manage all three environments from a single requirement document  
âœ… **Flexible Combinations**: Deploy to any subset or all environments (prod only, prod+reliance, all three, etc.)  
âœ… **Automatic Processing**: VIRAT handles environment detection and switching automatically  
âœ… **Proper Isolation**: Each environment gets its own feature branches and base branches  
âœ… **Sequential Execution**: Environments processed in order with complete workflow for each  
âœ… **Full Traceability**: All changes documented with environment-specific information  
âœ… **Zero Manual Intervention**: No manual branch switching needed  

---

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Production-Only Deployment
Deploy only to production (prod):
```markdown
**Environment**: prod
```

### Use Case 2: Client-Specific Deployment
Deploy to reliance and phoenix (client environments) only:
```markdown
**Environment**: reliance, phoenix
```

### Use Case 3: Staged Rollout
Deploy to all three environments in sequence (prod â†’ reliance â†’ phoenix):
```markdown
**Environment**: prod, reliance, phoenix
```
This allows for staged validation: test in prod first, then validate in reliance, finally in phoenix.

### Use Case 4: Hotfix Deployment
Deploy to specific environments as needed:
```markdown
**Environment**: prod, phoenix
```
Skip reliance and go directly from prod to phoenix.

## Implementation Details

### Environment-Specific Base Branches

VIRAT automatically switches repositories to the correct branches for each environment:

**Prod Environment**:
- Algorithm: `caas-release`
- LoadAPI: `release_optimised`
- Config: `caas-staging_fix`

**Reliance Environment**:
- Algorithm: `master-ril`
- LoadAPI: `caas-ril-uploads`
- Config: `master-ril`

**Phoenix Environment**:
- Algorithm: `master-adidas-reliance-prod`
- LoadAPI: `caas-phoenix-uploads`
- Config: `master-adidas-ril`

### Multi-Environment Processing Flow

```
Requirement Input (prod, reliance, phoenix)
       â†“
Environment Detection
       â†“
Process PROD:
  â”œâ”€â”€ Switch to prod branches
  â”œâ”€â”€ Create feature/REQ-1234-prod
  â”œâ”€â”€ Complete Phases 0-6
  â”œâ”€â”€ Push changes
       â†“
Process RELIANCE:

Process PHOENIX:
  â”œâ”€â”€ Switch to phoenix branches
  â”œâ”€â”€ Create feature/REQ-1234-phoenix

### Test 1: Single Prod Environment
```markdown
# Test Prod Deployment

**Environment**: prod
**Requirement ID**: TEST-PROD-001

## Description

```

Run: `*implement test-prod-deployment.md`

### Test 2: Multiple Environments (Prod + Reliance)
```markdown
# Test Multi-Environment

**Environment**: prod, reliance
**Requirement ID**: TEST-MULTI-001

## Description
Test deployment to prod and reliance environments.
```

Run: `*implement test-multi-env.md`

### Test 3: All Three Environments
```markdown
# Test All Environments

**Environment**: prod, reliance, phoenix
**Requirement ID**: TEST-ALL-001

## Description
Test deployment to all three environments.
```

Run: `*implement test-all-env.md`

## Verification Checklist

- âœ… Configuration in config.yaml: All three environments defined
- âœ… Documentation in multi-environment-support.md: Complete with prod
- âœ… Agent definition in virat.md: Updated activation instructions
- âœ… README.md: Updated with prod environment references
- âœ… Template document: Updated with environment examples
- âœ… Branch configurations: All correct and verified
- âœ… Use cases: Documented with prod examples

---

## Backward Compatibility

âœ… **Zero Breaking Changes**:
- Existing single-environment requirements still work unchanged
- Existing multi-environment (reliance, phoenix) workflows unchanged
- Only adds new capability for prod environment
- Fully backward compatible

---

## Summary

Prod environment is now fully integrated into VIRAT's multi-environment support system. Users can deploy to any combination of prod, reliance, and phoenix environments using a single requirement document with proper environment-specific base branches, automatic branch switching, and complete documentation for each environment.

**The system is ready for multi-environment deployments across all three production environments!** ðŸš€
