# Migration Workflow Feature Summary

## Overview

The **Migration Workflow** is a new VIRAT capability that enables intelligent cross-branch commit migration with automatic pattern adaptation. It analyzes all new commits in a source branch and systematically implements them in a target branch while respecting the target branch's patterns, conventions, and structure.

## What Was Created

### 1. **Main Command: `*implement-migration`**

Invokes the complete migration workflow with a simple command:

```bash
*implement-migration {repository} {source-branch} {target-branch}
```

**Features:**
- Analyzes all commits between source and target branches
- Intelligently adapts implementations to target patterns
- Validates against all 44 BMAD implementation rules
- Creates comprehensive documentation throughout process
- Supports multi-phase migration with validation at each step

### 2. **Migration Task: `migration-workflow.md`**

Comprehensive task file defining the complete migration workflow:

**File**: `tasks/migration-workflow.md`

**Contents:**

- Success criteria and error handling
- Key features and validation checklist

**Phases Covered:**
1. Setup & Validation
2. Requirement Analysis
3. Implementation Planning
4. Guided Implementation
5. Validation & Testing
6. Documentation

## Key Capabilities

### 1. **Intelligent Pattern Adaptation**

The workflow understands:
- Source branch patterns and structure
- Target branch patterns and conventions
- How to map implementations between patterns
- Branch-specific customizations needed

### 2. **Commit-by-Commit Analysis**

For each commit:
- Analyze business logic and requirements
- Extract implementation patterns
- Plan adaptations to target patterns
- Implement following target conventions
- Validate in target context
- Create atomic commit with references

### 3. **Comprehensive Validation**

Multi-layer validation ensures:
- Pattern compliance in target branch
- Business logic correctly implemented
- No breaking changes to existing code
- Full integration with target codebase
- All tests pass in target context

### 4. **Repository-Specific Strategies**

Tailored approaches for:
- **Algorithm Repository (Java)** - Module registration, class hierarchies, Args classes
- **LoadAPI Repository (Python)** - LoadAPI patterns, validation logic, imports
- **Configuration Repository (SQL)** - SQL views, templates, JSON configs
- **MFP Repository (Python)** - Services, routes, forecasting logic

### 5. **Complete Documentation**

Generates throughout process:
- `migration-analysis.md` - Commit breakdown and categorization
- `pattern-adaptation-mapping.md` - Source-to-target pattern mapping
- `adaptation-strategy.md` - Branch-specific customizations
- `migration-implementation-plan.md` - Step-by-step plan
- `commit-dependency-graph.md` - Commit ordering and dependencies
- `testing-strategy.md` - Test plan
- `risk-assessment.md` - Risk analysis
- Pattern compliance report
- Functional test results
- Integration test results
- Migration integrity report
- Quality validation report
- `MIGRATION_REPORT.md` - Comprehensive final report

## Usage Examples

### Backporting Production to Reliance

```bash
# Migrate Algorithm Repository
*implement-migration irisx-algo caas-release master-ril

# Migrate LoadAPI Repository
*implement-migration ms-loadapis-ril-final release_optimised caas-ril-uploads

# Migrate Configuration Repository
*implement-migration irisx-config caas-staging_fix master-ril
```

### Cherry-Picking to Phoenix

```bash
*implement-migration irisx-algo caas-release master-adidas-reliance-prod
*implement-migration ms-loadapis-ril-final release_optimised caas-phoenix-uploads
```

### Feature Branch Synchronization

```bash
*implement-migration irisx-algo feature/new-feature master-ril
```

## How It Works

### Phase-by-Phase Flow

1. **Setup**: Validate branches, identify commits to migrate, categorize by type
2. **Analysis**: Analyze patterns in source and target, extract business logic
3. **Planning**: Create implementation plan, identify dependencies, plan testing
4. **Feature Branch**: Create feature branch from target branch
5. **Execution**: Implement each commit following target patterns
6. **Validation**: Comprehensive validation and testing
7. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive migration documentation
8. **Finalization**: Merge feature branch, cleanup, push changes

### Each Commit Flow

For each commit in migration scope:

1. **Understand** - Read commit message, analyze what it implements
2. **Adapt** - Plan how to implement in target patterns
3. **Implement** - Make code changes following target conventions
4. **Validate** - Verify business logic correctly implemented
5. **Commit** - Create atomic commit with reference to source commit

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created

1. `tasks/migration-workflow.md` - Complete migration task definition
2. `workflows/migration-workflow.yaml` - Migration workflow in YAML
3. `docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - User guide for migration workflow
4. `docs/MIGRATION_WORKFLOW_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### Modified Files

1. `agents/virat.md` - Added migration commands and comprehensive documentation

## Integration with Existing System

The migration workflow integrates seamlessly with:

### VIRAT's 44 Implementation Rules

- All migrations are validated against applicable rules
- Rules guide pattern adaptation and implementation
- Rule violations are caught and reported

### Expert Agents

- **Architect** - Analyzes target branch patterns
- **Dev** - Implements migrations following patterns
- **QA** - Validates and tests migrations

### BMAD Personas

- **Analyst** - Analyzes requirement (migration scope)
- **PM** - Validates implementation plan
- **Dev** - Executes implementation
- **QA** - Performs comprehensive testing

## Success Criteria

A successful migration achieves:

✅ All identified commits successfully migrated to target branch
✅ Business logic correctly implemented in target patterns
✅ All validations passing in target branch context
✅ No breaking changes to existing target branch functionality
✅ Complete documentation of migration process
✅ Target branch patterns fully respected
✅ Cross-repository consistency maintained
✅ All tests passing post-merge
✅ Feature branch successfully merged and cleaned up

## Key Differentiators

### vs. Manual Cherry-Pick

- ❌ Manual: Time-consuming, error-prone, limited pattern adaptation
- ✅ Migration: Automated, intelligent, pattern-aware

### vs. Automatic Rebase

- ❌ Rebase: No pattern adaptation, assumes same structure
- ✅ Migration: Smart adaptation to different patterns and structures

### vs. Copy-Paste

- ❌ Copy-paste: No validation, no documentation, manual errors
- ✅ Migration: Comprehensive validation, complete docs, automated

## Use Cases Enabled

1. **Backporting Features** - Migrate features from prod to reliance/phoenix
2. **Bug Fix Distribution** - Distribute critical fixes across branches
3. **Environment Sync** - Keep multiple environments in sync
4. **Branch Consolidation** - Merge changes from branch variant to main
5. **Code Refactoring** - Systematically refactor across branch variants
6. **Dependency Updates** - Migrate dependency upgrades across branches

## Future Enhancements

Potential future additions:

- Selective commit migration (cherry-pick specific commits)
- Automatic conflict resolution strategies
- Custom pattern adaptation rules
- Performance optimization for large migrations
- Rollback capability for failed migrations
- Comparative reporting across environments
