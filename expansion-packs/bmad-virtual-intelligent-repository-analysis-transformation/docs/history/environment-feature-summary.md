# Environment Configuration Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
VIRAT Agent has been enhanced to support multiple environments (prod, reliance, phoenix) with different base branches across the three repositories. The environment is automatically detected from requirement documents with minimal changes to existing functionality.

---

## What Was Changed

### ‚úÖ 1. Configuration File (`config.yaml`)
**Added**: Environment-specific base branch configuration

```yaml
environments:
  prod:
    name: "Prod"
    base_branches:
      algorithm: "caas-release"
      loadapi: "release_optimised"
      config: "caas-staging_fix"
  
  reliance:
    name: "Reliance"
    base_branches:
      algorithm: "master-ril"
      loadapi: "caas-ril-uploads"
      config: "master-ril"
  
  phoenix:
    name: "Phoenix"
    base_branches:
      algorithm: "master-adidas-reliance-prod"
      loadapi: "caas-phoenix-uploads"
      config: "master-adidas-ril"
```

---

### ‚úÖ 2. VIRAT Agent (`agents/virat.md`)

#### Updated Sections:
1. **Activation Instructions** - Added environment detection step
2. **Commands** - Added `show-env` command
3. **Rule 14** - Updated branch management with environment support
4. **Phase 0** - Added environment detection and environment-specific base branches
5. **All Implementation Phases** - Updated to reference environment-specific branches

#### Key Changes:
- Environment auto-detection from requirement document
- Environment-specific base branch switching
- Environment context in documentation
- Support for three environments: prod, reliance, phoenix

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Requirement Document Template (`templates/requirement-document-tmpl.md`)

**Added**:
```markdown
**Environment**: {ENVIRONMENT}  <!-- prod | reliance | phoenix -->
```

**Updated**:
- Repository Access section now shows environment-specific base branches
- Completion checklist includes environment validation
- All references updated to support multi-environment

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Documentation Files Created

#### `docs/ENVIRONMENT_CONFIGURATION.md`
Comprehensive guide covering:
- All three environments with base branches
- How to specify environment in requirement documents
- Commands for environment management
- Example workflows
- Troubleshooting guide
- Best practices

#### `templates/requirement-document-example.md`
Template showing:
- How to add environment field
- Environment configuration for each environment
- Example requirement structure

---

### ‚úÖ 5. README Updated (`README.md`)

**Added**:
- Multi-Environment Support as first feature
- Environment Configuration section with table of all environments
- Link to detailed environment configuration guide

---

## How It Works

### For Single Environment:
1. **Add environment to requirement document**:
   ```markdown
   **Environment**: reliance
   ```

2. **Run VIRAT**:
   ```bash
   *implement REQ-1234.md
   ```

3. **VIRAT automatically**:
   - Detects environment: `reliance`
   - Switches to appropriate branches
   - Creates feature branches
   - Implements changes
   - Documents with environment context

### For Multiple Environments:
1. **Add multiple environments (comma-separated)**:
   ```markdown
   **Environment**: reliance, phoenix
   ```

2. **Run VIRAT**:
   ```bash
   *implement REQ-1234.md
   ```

3. **VIRAT automatically**:
   - Detects both environments: `reliance`, `phoenix`
   - **Processes First (reliance)**:
     - Switches to reliance branches
     - Implements completely
     - Pushes changes
   - **Then Processes Second (phoenix)**:
     - Switches to phoenix branches
     - Implements completely
     - Pushes changes
   - Both environments now have the feature!

## Supported Environments

| Environment | Algorithm Branch | LoadAPI Branch | Config Branch |
|------------|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **prod** | caas-release | release_optimised | caas-staging_fix |
| **reliance** | master-ril | caas-ril-uploads | master-ril |
| **phoenix** | master-adidas-reliance-prod | caas-phoenix-uploads | master-adidas-ril |

---

## Minimal Changes Principle

‚úÖ **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved  
‚úÖ **Backward Compatible**: Requirements without environment field default to PROD  
‚úÖ **Automatic Detection**: No manual configuration needed per requirement  
‚úÖ **Single Field Addition**: Only one field added to requirement documents  
‚úÖ **Configuration-Based**: Easy to add new environments in config.yaml  

---

## Files Modified

1. ‚úèÔ∏è `config.yaml` - Added environments section
2. ‚úèÔ∏è `agents/virat.md` - Updated for environment support
3. ‚úèÔ∏è `templates/requirement-document-tmpl.md` - Added environment field
4. ‚úèÔ∏è `README.md` - Added environment documentation
5. ‚ûï `docs/ENVIRONMENT_CONFIGURATION.md` - New comprehensive guide
6. ‚ûï `templates/requirement-document-example.md` - New example template
7. ‚ûï `ENVIRONMENT_FEATURE_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Example Usage

### Requirement Document Header
```markdown
# Requirement: Add Store Performance Validation

**Requirement ID**: REQ-2345  
**Environment**: reliance  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Created**: 2025-10-13  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-13  
**Assigned To**: Dev Team

## Description
Implement store performance validation for the Reliance environment...
```

### VIRAT Output
```
üî¨ VIRAT - VIRTUAL INTELLIGENT Repository ANALYSIS AND TRANSFORMATION

‚úÖ Environment Detected: reliance
‚úÖ Base Branches:
   - Algorithm (irisx-algo): master-ril
   - LoadAPI (ms-loadapis-ril-final): caas-ril-uploads
   - Config (irisx-config): master-ril

üîÑ Switching to base branches...
‚úÖ All repositories on correct branches

üìã Starting implementation workflow...
```

---

## Commands Added

### `*show-env`
Display current environment and base branch configuration
```bash
*show-env
```

**Output**:
```
Current Environment: reliance
Base Branches:
  - irisx-algo: master-ril
  - ms-loadapis-ril-final: caas-ril-uploads
  - irisx-config: master-ril
```

---

## Testing & Validation

### To Test:
1. Create a requirement document with `Environment: reliance`
2. Run `*implement requirement.md`
3. Verify VIRAT:
   - Detects correct environment
   - Switches to correct branches
   - Creates feature branches from correct bases
   - Documents environment in output

### Validation Checklist:
- [ ] Environment detected from requirement document
- [ ] Correct base branches used for each environment
- [ ] Feature branches created from environment-specific bases
- [ ] Documentation includes environment information
- [ ] All three repositories coordinated correctly
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained (prod as default)

---

## Next Steps (If Needed)

### Adding More Environments:
1. Edit `config.yaml`
2. Add new environment with base branches
3. Update documentation if needed

### Customizing for Specific Use Cases:
- Modify `config.yaml` for additional metadata per environment
- Update agent logic for environment-specific behaviors
- Add environment-specific validation rules

---

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check `docs/ENVIRONMENT_CONFIGURATION.md` for detailed guide
2. Use `*show-env` command to debug environment detection
3. Verify `Environment` field is in requirement document header
4. Ensure environment name matches: `prod`, `reliance`, or `phoenix`

## Summary

‚úÖ **Implementation Complete**  
‚úÖ **All Documentation Updated**  
‚úÖ **Minimal Changes Made**  
‚úÖ **No Breaking Changes**  
‚úÖ **Ready for Use**

The environment configuration feature is now fully integrated into VIRAT with minimal changes to existing functionality. Simply add the `Environment` field to your requirement documents, and VIRAT will handle the rest automatically.
