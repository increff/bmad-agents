# Historical Documentation

This folder contains historical summaries documenting the evolution of the VIRAT system.

## Purpose

These files are **intentionally preserved** as historical documentation, even though they are not actively referenced in the current codebase. They serve as:

- **Audit Trail**: Track the evolution of system features and architecture
- **Design Decisions**: Document why certain implementation choices were made
- **Context**: Provide background for understanding current architecture
- **Onboarding**: Help new team members understand how the system evolved
- **Reference**: Historical context for future refactoring decisions

- **environment-feature-summary.md** - Multi-environment support implementation
- **improvements-branch-summary.md** - Major improvements to branch handling

### Maintenance & Cleanup Summaries

- **cleanup-and-flow-summary.md** - Code cleanup and workflow improvements
- **critical-fixes-summary.md** - Critical bug fixes and their resolutions
