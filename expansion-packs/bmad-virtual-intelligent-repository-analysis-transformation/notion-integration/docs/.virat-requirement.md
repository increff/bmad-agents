## Requirement Content

Detailed context for bmad

In planogram creation module we currently use only a single attribute, and calculate planogram at that level. 

Now we need to add one more attribute, let’s call it attribute1, should be the same column name as present in planogram input. 

Also the level at which planogram needs to be computed should be based on an input parameter → just one attribute, or at 2 attribute level. 

The calculations would remain, just the level at which the final output is computed changes, and wherever the computation happens at the attribute level, based on the input parameter we will need to compute at the required level.
