# Multi-Environment Support - Feature Update

## Overview
VIRAT now supports **multiple environments in a single requirement document**. When you specify multiple environments (comma-separated), VIRAT will process each environment sequentially, completing the full implementation workflow for each.

---

## Usage

### Single Environment (Previous Behavior)
```markdown
**Environment**: reliance
```

### Multiple Environments (New Feature)
```markdown
**Environment**: reliance, phoenix
```

---

## How It Works

When you specify **multiple environments** (e.g., `reliance, phoenix`):

### Sequential Processing Flow:

1. **First Environment (reliance)**:
   - ✅ Switch to reliance base branches
   - ✅ Create feature branches: `feature/REQ-1234-description-reliance`
   - ✅ Complete all 6 implementation phases (0-6)
   - ✅ Run tests
   - ✅ Document changes
   - ✅ **Push changes to repository**

2. **Second Environment (phoenix)**:
   - ✅ Switch to phoenix base branches
   - ✅ Create feature branches: `feature/REQ-1234-description-phoenix`
   - ✅ Complete all 6 implementation phases (0-6)
   - ✅ Run tests
   - ✅ Document changes
   - ✅ **Push changes to repository**

3. **Result**: Both environments have the feature implemented!

## Example

### Requirement Document
```markdown
# Requirement: Add Store Performance Validation

**Requirement ID**: REQ-7890  
**Environment**: reliance, phoenix  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Created**: 2025-10-13

## Description
Add store performance validation logic for both Reliance and Phoenix environments.
This validation needs to be consistent across both environments.
```

### VIRAT Execution
```bash
*implement REQ-7890.md
```

### Output
```

## Valid Formats

### Two Environments
```markdown
**Environment**: reliance, phoenix
```

### Three Environments
```markdown
**Environment**: prod, reliance, phoenix
```

### With Spaces
```markdown
**Environment**: reliance , phoenix
```

All formats work - VIRAT trims whitespace automatically.

## What Changed (Minimal Changes)

### Files Updated:

1. **`agents/virat.md`**
   - Added multi-environment detection in activation instructions
   - Updated `*implement` command description
   - Added multi-environment processing to Phase 0
   - Added note about sequential processing to Phase 1
   - Updated Phase 4 git operations for multi-environment
   - Added final note about returning to Phase 0 for next environment

2. **`config.yaml`**
   - Updated comment to mention multi-environment support

3. **`templates/requirement-document-tmpl.md`**
   - Updated Environment field comment to show multiple environment example

4. **`docs/ENVIRONMENT_CONFIGURATION.md`**
   - Added Multiple Environment Workflow section with complete example
   - Updated detection logic documentation
   - Added valid multi-environment format examples

5. **`ENVIRONMENT_FEATURE_SUMMARY.md`**
   - Added "For Multiple Environments" workflow section

6. **`README.md`**
   - Updated "How it works" section to mention multi-environment support

---

## Branch Naming Convention

When multiple environments are specified:

- **Single Environment**: `feature/REQ-1234-description`
- **Multiple Environments**: `feature/REQ-1234-description-{environment}`

Examples:
- `feature/REQ-7890-store-validation-reliance`
- `feature/REQ-7890-store-validation-phoenix`

---

## Benefits

✅ **Single Requirement Document**: Manage both environments in one place  
✅ **Consistent Implementation**: Same logic applied to both environments  
✅ **Automatic Processing**: No manual intervention needed  
✅ **Separate Branches**: Each environment gets its own feature branches  
✅ **Independent Pushes**: Changes pushed after each environment completes  
✅ **Complete Documentation**: Full traceability for both environments  

---

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Identical Feature Across Environments
```markdown
**Environment**: reliance, phoenix
```
Deploy the exact same feature to both environments.

### Use Case 2: Staged Rollout
```markdown
**Environment**: reliance
```
First deploy to reliance, test, then update document:
```markdown
**Environment**: phoenix
```
Deploy to phoenix after validation.

### Use Case 3: Multi-Client Deployment
```markdown
**Environment**: prod, reliance, phoenix
```
Deploy to all three environments in sequence.

---

## Notes

- ✅ **Zero Breaking Changes**: Single environment still works exactly as before
- ✅ **Minimal Code Changes**: Only essential updates made
- ✅ **Fully Backward Compatible**: Existing requirements work without modification
- ✅ **Push After Each**: Changes are pushed after each environment completes (not at the end)
- ✅ **Independent Workflows**: Each environment goes through complete Phase 0-6

---

## Summary

Multi-environment support allows you to:
1. Specify multiple environments in a single requirement
2. VIRAT processes each sequentially
3. Each environment gets complete implementation
4. Changes pushed after each environment
5. Both environments end up with the feature

**Simple, efficient, and minimal changes!** 🚀
