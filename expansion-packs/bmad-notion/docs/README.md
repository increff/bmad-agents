## Purpose

This folder centralizes all Notion integration data in one location, making it easier to:
- Track what has been extracted and when
- Manage implementation workflows
- Debug integration issues
- Keep the project root clean

## Note

All files in this folder are temporary/transient data and are typically **not committed to git** (see `.gitignore`).
They are regenerated each time you extract data from Notion.
