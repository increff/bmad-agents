- **IDE**: Cursor, Claude Code, or other supported IDE

### Step-by-Step Installation

#### 1. Navigate to Your Project Directory
```bash
cd /path/to/your/main/project
# This should be your main development workspace
```

#### 2. Run BMAD Installer
```bash

```

**IDE Configuration:**
```
? Which IDE(s) do you want to configure:
  ‚òë Cursor
  ‚òë Claude Code
  ‚òê Other IDEs...
```

**Repository Paths (CRITICAL):**
```
üìã ARYA Configuration

? Enter the local path to your Algorithm repository (irisx-algo): 
  /Users/yourname/projects/irisx-algo

? Enter the local path to your Config repository (irisx-config):
  /Users/yourname/projects/irisx-config

? Enter the local path to your MFP repository (ms-mfp):
  /Users/yourname/projects/ms-mfp

```
? Which environment?
  ‚òê Phoenix
  ‚òë Reliance
```

#### 4. Verify Installation
```bash
ls -la .bmad-advanced-response-yield-assistant/
# Should contain: agents/, tasks/, templates/, config.yaml

ls -la .cursor/rules/bmad/
# Should contain: arya.mdc, mfp-pattern-expert.mdc, etc.
```

### Troubleshooting Installation

**Repository Path Errors:**
```
Error: Cannot access repository at /path/to/repo
```
